## Project 4: Advance Lane Finding - Directory for File Structure

* "AdvLaneFinding_Submit.ipynb" is the Jupyter Notebook for the lane finding and visualization code
* "AdvLaneFinding_Submit_RevA.ipynb" is a revision of the original code to include correction for distortion and center-lane departure estimation
* "AdvLaneFinding_2.ipynb" is a reference Jupyter Notebook I created for development purposes
* "AdvLaneFinding_Submit.py" is the Python verison of the same code, used to indicate line number for codes
* "AdvLaneFinding_WriteUp.md" is the writeup of the project
* "LaneDetectedVideo.mp4" is the video output from my code, which include lane detection, curvature information and lane departure value
"LaneDetectedVideo_RevA.mp4" is revision A of the LaneDetectedVideo.mp4.  The new version corrected for distortion and the lane-center departure distance is corrected to improve the estimation
* Folder "Images" contains the images you will find in the writeup
* Folder "Project_Videos" contains the source videos provide for this project
* Folder "camera_cal" contains chessboard images used for camera calibration
* Folder "test_imgs" contains road images for code testing
