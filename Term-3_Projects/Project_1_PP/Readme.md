# **Term 3 Project 1: Path Planning Project**
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

The goals of this project are the following:

* Implement a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic
* Using locaalization, sensor fusion and map data, the path planner will be able to keep the car inside its lane, avoid hitting other cars, and pass slower moving traffic
* The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident
* The car drives according to the speed limit
* The car does not exceed a total acceleration of 10 m/s^2 and a jerk of 10 m/s^3
* Car does not have collisions
* The car doesn't spend more than a 3 second length out side the lane lanes during changing lanes, and every other time the car stays inside one of the 3 lanes on the right hand side of the road

### Path Planner Implementation

The code model for generating paths that satisfy the listed goals is described in detail in this report.  This project uses the Term 3 Simulator to provide visualization of the vehicle opeation, as well as feeding data to the C++ path planning code for path generation.  The focus of this project is to generate a path that the vehicle can follow while satisfying the given goals.  The control aspect of autonomous vehicle operation is assumed to be handled by the simulator and it will not be addressed in this project.   It is also assumed that other vehicles in the simulator will obey the traffic laws and will not drive in a dangerous manner to cause accident.

### General Motion

The vehicle in the simulator will move from one path point to the next one every 20 ms.  Therefore, in order to move the vehicle on the road, a series of x,y pair path points need to be created, and these path points will form the trajectory of the vehicle.  Velocity of the vehicle will be controlled by the spacing between these path points.  The goal is to achieve 50 MPH without passing this limit in all situation while maximizing the speed.  Localization information is provided by the simulator and they are loaded into main.cpp from line 231 to 236.  Both 2D cartesian coordinates and Frenet coordinates are given to describe the state of the vehicle. Since it is required that the acceleration and jerk does not exceed the prescribed limit, the starting velocity of the vehicle is set to 0 (main.cpp, line 210), and the linear acceleration of the vehicle is set to 0.224 m/s^2 (main.cpp, line 470 to 473), which was found to be acceptable for the requirements.  Angular acceleration and jerk is controlled by the linear acceleration and the how the trajectory is created.  These will be discussed in the following sections.
